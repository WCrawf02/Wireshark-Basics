# ðŸš¨Wireshark Unleashed: Mastering Network Traffic for PenTest+ ðŸ¦ˆ

Welcome to my **Wireshark** project! In the world of penetration testing, capturing and analyzing network traffic is a superpower, and Wireshark is your X-ay vision into the digital world. Whether you're uncovering vulnerabilities, dissecting suspicious packets, or tracking down elusive threats, Wireshark is the ultimate tool for diving deep into network activity. In this project, I will demonstrate how to leverage Wireshark's capabilities for practical network analysis and security assessments as part of my CompTIA PenTest+ journey. Get ready to decode the network matrix like a pro.

**Task 2 Module - Tool Overview**:

- **Objective**: Use Wireshark to capture/analyze network traffic for security assessments.
- **Role**: Essential tool in penetration testing for identifying vulnerabilities and investigating suspicious activity.
- **Focus Area**: Packet capture, protcol analysis, network traffic inspection.
- **Goal**: Showcase Wireshark's power in practical network analysis and cybersecurity operations.

Task questions were fairly easy to answer.  Working with the 'Exercise.pcapng' file, we were able to fulfill the task requirements.  Once on the GUI page for the file, I navigated to the Statistics option located in the toolbar, capture file properties, and answered the task correctly.
